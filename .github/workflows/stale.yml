            We want to keep our issues up to date and active. This issue hasn't seen any activity in the last 75 days.
            We have applied the `_flag:stale` label to indicate that this issue should be reviewed again.
            When you review, please reread the spec and then apply one of these three options:
            - prioritize: apply the `flag:schedule` label to suggest moving this issue into the backlog now
            - close: if the issue is no longer relevant, explain why (give others a chance to reply) and then close.
            - archive: sometimes an issue has important information or ideas but we won't work on it soon. In this case
            apply the `someday` label to show that this won't be prioritized. The stalebot will ignore issues with this
            label in the future. Use sparingly!
