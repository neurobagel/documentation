# Getting Help

There are several ways you can interact with the Neurobagel team:

- Our tag on the [Neurostars forum](https://neurostars.org/tag/neurobagel)
- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BEXXgt3hXk) to chat with us

## General usage questions

If you have a _usage question_ about Neurobagel (feedback on a specific use case),
or want to _discuss the Neurobagel project in general_ with the development team or other users,
please either:

- search for or start a new thread on Neurostars with the `neurobagel` tag: [https://neurostars.org/tag/neurobagel](https://neurostars.org/tag/neurobagel) or
- send us a message in the [Neurobagel Discord server](https://discord.gg/BEXXgt3hXk)

## Problem with deploying a Neurobagel node

If you encounter a problem while deploying a Neurobagel node,
first make sure you are following our [getting started guide](user_guide/getting_started.md) correctly.
If your problem persists, please open a [node deployment issue](https://github.com/neurobagel/recipes/issues/new?template=deployment_issue.yml) on GitHub.

## Report a bug or request a feature

For _bug reports_ or _feature requests_, we prefer if you open an issue in the repository for the relevant tool in the [Neurobagel GitHub organization](https://github.com/neurobagel).

If you are using one of our web tools ([https://annotate.neurobagel.org](https://annotate.neurobagel.org) or [https://query.neurobagel.org](https://query.neurobagel.org)),
you may also submit bug reports and feature requests using the feedback widget directly on the app.

## Documentation feedback

We are always looking to improve our user documentation.
To request a change or addition to existing documentation, please [open an issue in the `neurobagel/documentation` repo](https://github.com/neurobagel/documentation/issues).

## Propose a new variable to be added to the Neurobagel data model

If there is a variable you'd like to be able to harmonize and query using Neurobagel that is not [currently supported](data_models/variables.md),
please suggest it using a discussion in our dedicated [GitHub Discussion category](https://github.com/orgs/neurobagel/discussions/categories/subject-data-model-requests).
