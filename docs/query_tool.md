# The Neurobagel Query Tool

Neurobagel's query tool is a web interface for searching across a Neurobagel graph based on various subject clinical-demographic and imaging parameters.

The query tool is a Vue application, developed in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) using a variety of tools including [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), and [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs).

## Quickstart

The query tool is hosted at https://query.neurobagel.org/ and interfaces with [Neurobagel API](https://api.neurobagel.org/docs).

NOTE: Currently, to access the query tool, you must be connected to the McGill network.

## Local Installation

### Install Dependencies

To run the query tool, you'll need [node package manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
You can find the instructions on installing npm and node in the official [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once you have npm and node installed, you'll need to install the dependencies outlined in the package.json file.
You can do so by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

**use node v16.x LTS**!

:warning: 
The query tool is built with the Nuxt framework and currently depends on Nuxt2. 
Nuxt2 does not support node versions beyond the v16 LTS (see e.g. [this Github issue](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/10844)).
If you want to run the tool locally, make sure you are using node v16.x.
A good way to manage different node versions is to use the [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) tool.

### Set the Environment Variables

You'll need to set the `API_QUERY_URL` environment variable required to run the query tool. `API_QUERY_URL` is the [Neurobagel API](https://github.com/neurobagel/api) URL that the query tool uses to send requests to for results. The query tool utilizes [nuxt dotenv module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/dotenv-module) for managing environment variables. 

To set environment variables, create an `.env` file in the root directory and add the environment variables there. If you're running the Neurobagel API locally on your machine (following the instructions [here](https://github.com/neurobagel/api#local-installation)), your `.env` file would look something like this:

```bash
API_QUERY_URL=http://localhost:8000/
```

if you're using the remote api, your `.env` file would look something like this:

```bash
API_QUERY_URL=https://api.neurobagel.org/
```

### Launch the Query Tool

To launch the tool in developer mode run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also build and then run the tool from the (production) build of the application by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

You can verify the tool is running once you receive info messages from Nuxt regarding environment, rendering, and what port the tool is running on in your terminal.

## Usage

### Running a query
To define a cohort, set your inclusion criteria using the following:

- Age: Minimum and/or maximum age (in years) of participant that should be included in the results.
- Sex: Sex of participant that should be included in the results.
- Diagnosis: Diagnosis of participant that should be included in the results
- Healthy control: Whether healthy participants should be included in the results. Once healthy control checkbox is selected, diagnosis field will be disabled since a participant cannot be both a healthy control and have a diagnosis.
- Minimum number of sessions: Minimum number of imaging sessions that participant should have to be included in the results.
- Assessment tool: Non-imaging assessment completed by participant that should be included in the results.
- Modality: Imaging modality of participant scans that should be included in the results.


Once you've defined your criteria, submit them as a query and the query tool will display the results.

### Downloading query results

For a given query, the query tool offers two kinds of TSV files for results that users can download. 
At least one dataset matching the query must be selected in the interface in order to download the query results.

#### Dataset-level results

The dataset-level results TSV describes the datasets that contain subjects matching the user's query.
This TSV contains the following columns:

- `DatasetID`: unique identifier (UUID) for dataset in the graph. 
Note that this ID is not guaranteed to be persistent across versions of a graph/across graphs, but will always be identical across a pair of query tool result files. 
_This column can be used as the key to join the dataset-level and participant-level results TSVs for a given query result, if needed._
- `DatasetName`: human readable name of the dataset
- `PortalURI`: URL to a website or page about the dataset, if available
- `NumMatchingSubjects`: (aggregate variable) number of subjects matching the query within the dataset
- `AvailableImageModalites`: (aggregate variable) list of unique imaging modalities available for the dataset

Example:

{{ read_table('./repos/neurobagel_examples/query-tool-results/dataset-level-results.tsv') }}

#### Participant-level results

The participant-level results TSV contains the available harmonized participant attributes for subject sessions matching the query in each (selected) matching dataset.
Each row in the TSV corresponds to a single matching subject _session_.

This TSV contains the following columns:

- `DatasetID`: unique identifier (UUID) for dataset in the graph. 
Note that this ID is not guaranteed to be persistent across versions of a graph/across graphs, but will always be identical across a pair of query tool result files. 
_This column can be used as the key to join the dataset-level and participant-level results TSVs for a given query result, if needed._
- `SubjectID`: subject label
- `Age`: subject age, if available
- `Sex`: subject sex, if available
- `Diagnosis`: list of diagnoses of subject, if available
- `Assessment` : list of assessments completed by subject, if available
- `SessionID`: session label
- `SessionPath`: the path of the session directory relative to the dataset root (for datasets available through DataLad) or root of the filesystem where the dataset is stored
- `NumSessions`: (aggregate variable) total number of available sessions for subject. 
This number will be the same across rows corresponding to the same subject.
- `Modality`: imaging modalities acquired in the session, if available

Example:

{{ read_table('./repos/neurobagel_examples/query-tool-results/participant-level-results.tsv') }}

#### `protected` participant-level results in aggregate mode

If the values for all columns except for `DatasetID` and `SessionPath` in the participant-level results tsv are set to `protected`, this indicates the graph being queried has been configured (via its corresponding Neurobagel node API) to return only aggregate information about matches (due to data privacy reasons). This configuration can be modified by setting the `NB_RETURN_AGG` environment variable to `false` (the value is by default `true`). see related section of the documentation [here](https://neurobagel.org/infrastructure/#set-the-environment-variables).

Example:

{{ read_table('./repos/neurobagel_examples/query-tool-results/participant-level-results-agg.tsv') }}
