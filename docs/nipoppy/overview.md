## What is Nipoppy (formerly mr_proc)? 
*Process long and prosper*

---

Nipoppy is a workflow manager for:

1. MRI and tabular data curation
2. Standardized processing 
3. Raw + processed data tracking

---

## Modules

1. `Code`: Codebase [repo](code_org.md) for running and tracking workflows
2. `Data`: [Dataset](data_org.md) organized in a specific directory structure
3. `Containers`: Singularity containers encapsulating your processing pipelines


## Objectives
1. Standardized data i.e. convert DICOMs into BIDS
2. Run commonly used image processing pipelines e.g. FreeSurfer, fMRIPrep
3. Organize processed MR data inside `derivatives` directory
4. Organize demographic and clinical assessment data inside `tabular` directory
5. Run tracker scripts to populate `bagel.csv` with tabular and processing pipeline metadata
6. Provide metadata to `NeuroBagel` to allow dashboarding and querying participants across multiple studies
