!!! note "Nipoppy docs are moving"

    Nipoppy is undergoing a major refactor to move from scripts to a 
    command-line interface (CLI) and Python API. The new documentation website
    (work in progress) can be found at [nipoppy.readthedocs.io](nipoppy.readthedocs.io).

    If you are using the (soon-to-be legacy) scripts from Nipoppy 0.1.0, this is
    still the correct place to be. But we encourage you to check out the new
    website!
