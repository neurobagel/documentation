# Welcome to Neurobagel!

Neurobagel is a tool ecosystem that connects decentralized neuroimaging datasets using harmonized terminology and linked data principles, while allowing data files and access control to remain locally with research institutes. Neurobagel provides reusable data schemas and intuitive tools to help users with a range of programming experience:

- :pencil: **Annotate phenotypic data** using widely adopted, standardized vocabularies (e.g. [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [SNOMED-CT](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/index.html), [Cognitive Atlas](https://www.cognitiveatlas.org/)),
- :link: **Integrate harmonized participant (meta)data** in FAIR knowledge graphs based on semantic web standards,
- :mag_right: **Search for and define novel study cohorts** by aggregating participants across datasets
