# Community vocabularies for consortia (beta)

!!! info
    This section describes an early-stage feature under active development.

We are actively developing support for Neurobagel "community" vocabularies: custom standardized vocabularies of terms which are curated and governed by individual research consortia. 
This feature allows a consortium to use more detailed or domain-specific standardized terms than are available in the [core set of external ontologies](dictionaries.md) provided by Neurobagel, 
ensuring more precise harmonization of phenotypic data across an existing network of sites.

Community vocabularies can be integrated into the Neurobagel ecosystem and made available for tabular data annotation by consortium members.

Example of community vocabulary selection in the annotation tool:

![Annotation tool community configuration dropdown](../imgs/annotation_community_config.png)

We have developed an initial workflow for creating and integrating a community vocabulary of **assessment terms** into Neurobagel. 
Interested consortia are invited to [contact the Neurobagel maintainer team](../getting_help.md) to begin the onboarding process as a Neurobagel community.

For more information on creating a community vocabulary for your consortium, see the [neurobagel/communities](https://github.com/neurobagel/communities/blob/main/README.md) repository.
