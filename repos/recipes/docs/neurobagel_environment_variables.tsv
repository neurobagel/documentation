`NB_API_QUERY_URL`	No	(Testing only) URL of the Neurobagel f-API that the query tool will send its requests to. The query tool sends requests from a user's machine, so ensure the API URL is provided *as a user would access it from their own machine*. See also the [query tool README](https://github.com/neurobagel/query-tool?tab=readme-ov-file#set-the-environment-variables). In a production deployment this variable is ignored.	http://localhost:8080	Docker
`NB_QUERY_APP_BASE_PATH`	No	(If using reverse proxy) The URL path for the query tool, determines the specific URL at which the app should be rendered for users to access it	`/`	Docker
`NB_QUERY_DOMAIN`	Yes	(Production only) The domain name where the query tool will be hosted from	`""`	Docker
`NB_CONFIG`	No	**(Experimental)** Name of the Neurobagel community configuration to load, if the node uses a community's custom vocabularies.	`Neurobagel`	Docker, Python
